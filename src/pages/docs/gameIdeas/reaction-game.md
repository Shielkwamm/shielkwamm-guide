Everyone's rating system is a little bit different, here are some examples of rating systems:
```
{
  name: "Islamic",
  ratings: [
    "Sahih",
    "Hasan",
    "Daif"
  ]
},
{
  name: "_sh_",
  ratings: get_sh_Count()
},
{
  name: "Melanin",
  ratings: [
    "Extra",
    "Ish",
    "Real",
    "Fire"
  ]
},
{
  name: "RegEx",
  ratings: [
    "Greedy",
    "Lazy"
  ]
}
```
