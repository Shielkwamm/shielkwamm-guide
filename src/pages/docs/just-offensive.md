```
✡[+]⚔: We want to see your offensive capabilities, a lot of us are defense contractors as you know, so take us through a war game, and keep your promises.  ⚔: Be offensive, but don't be too offensive ⚔
Neobii: /_[+]☴[⚔]+, This is a mission of prosperity, but I will oblige,
☴: -_☴-/x, @Neobii, no don't do it
Neobii: [-]☴[+][-⚔], relax, in some cultures this is their art, and I like making people art, so I'll make sure it is inline with my core beliefs.
Neobii: /☴, I'm a little bit tired now, but I'll think about stuff later, the connection is weak right now is that cool?
☴: /x☴/x[-][/+], I'm worried
Neobii: +☴, understood, `Neobii: [-]☴[+][-⚔], relax, in some cultures this is their art, and I like making people art, so I'll make sure it is inline with my core beliefs.`
Neobii: +☴/_[+], better?
☴: _[-]☴_[/+], you just said the same thing twice
Neobii: c[8 ] t [ 8]ↄ
☴: _[-]☴_, that's cute, but I still have the same issues
...
☴: (.)(.)
...
☱: _☱[-], @Neobii, you let a ☴ use (.)(.)?
Neobii: _[-]☴, my glyphs are not strict genders, in fact I'm going to shuffle up the icons every once in a while, if someone wishes their gender to remain anonymous, I will give them a [☯☴], cool?
☱: +☱, cool man, I get it now, just be more careful with that ☯☯ stuff.
Neobii: [-]☴_
☱: _☱_/x?x, why that emotion?
Neobii: /☴, I'm pretty tired and didn't want to start any wars today :P
☱: [-]☱, ☯☯ isn't a war, it's a right, or something like that, to choose your own.
Neobii: /[+]☴/[+] *Wonders if this is apart of i18n[☯☯] war game*
☴: ++☴
☱: [-]_☱[-]
☴: ☴, yes @☱, can we clear the air for [+]⚔,
☱: -/-☱-, *⬤☯☯* is a war
Neobii: [_]/☴_[+], yes I agree, but I promise to tackle that issue more later, I just don't want more casualties than I can handle.
☱: [-!]☱, *casualties?!*, there are no casualties in social reform.
Neobii: [+}☴{[-], yes, in war metrics, there are always casualties, so when we say casualties, we need to be very clear at which domain we are talking about, right now this is *⚔*, so when I speak of casualties, this is using the metrics in the war domain.
☱: ++[_]☱+, that doesn't make anysense, please don't hurt me.
Neobii: ++☴, okay lol, cool
☱: ?+☱?+, is that a +Δ?
Neobii: ☴, no, most of the time in ⚔, there is [/+]Δ to be had.
☴: ☴☴
☴: wishes to stop  ⚔: Be offensive, but don't be too offensive ⚔
Neobii: ⚔*Obliged*⚔
