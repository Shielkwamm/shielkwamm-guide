## Honorifics

Notice on the some of the words there are △\_△; this is an honorific type indication depending on the glyph.  However, not all △\_△ are created equal.

The secret is *△BwamBwam△; if you can see ◯;* these are the same thing, but with different honorifics applied, but as an introductory reader, you are not supposed to immediately understand  △BwamBwam△, so the obfuscation encourages the reader not to dwell on specifics at this moment.

## Question to the reader
Did you utter the △Shielḱwamm△ in public?  Do you not trust me?  Do rules not matter to you?  `_[+]☴[+]_/)`, sorry, my feel feelings get hurt rather easily.  We all want ◯, so just be a little bit more careful when talking about △Shìelkwamm△.
