At  △Shìelkwamm△ there is a lot of information out there
in unlike a regular game, you can't turn over every nook and cranny to explore 100% of the map so I emphasize in △Shielḱwamm△ to pick the sets of knowledge that make you  `+☴`.
The object is not to get to map 100%, so a discrete linear process of learning like that is a bit different basically like tuning out bad, not applicable, or information just made for press, and we need this badly in today's news climate because knowing everything takes you farther from being able to say  ==== Shielkwamm ====.


I use things like grammar and glyphs on [△ Pröfess the △Shìelkwamm△_△](https://github.com/Shielkwamm/one_Z-rk/wiki/).

I'd say that this really isn't a constructed language, but how an existing language might be modified if we find a new set of material properties.

Like in △ Shìelkwamm △, it has an extra layer of grammar that pulls from emotional consensus
grammar rules are very often prescriptive, so with the addition of  ☴, being prescriptive describes it less.  Using vague symbols encourages the reader to "feel" what that means through intuition

If a term I produce is not yet meant to be understood, I will use proper obfuscation to keep the reader moving forward and just trying to let the information flow in.

> If you master ▵Zorking▵, then you can see △BwamBwam△; if you can see ◯, then you are allowed to say ==== Shielelelekwámm ====.
