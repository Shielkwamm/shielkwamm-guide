## â˜¯ - cypher
This is a little bit different than regular top down structure, if ðŸ¦• can figure out the â˜¯, then they have more informati0n.  Being able to figure out the â˜¯ creates a *topDownStructure* based on ðŸ”¬ and not ðŸ•‘ in most cases.  This also helps with *needToKnow* as you can create a cypher targeted for a specific login and they use the â˜¯ to decode informati0n.
