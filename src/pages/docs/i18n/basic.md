## ☯ - cypher
This is a little bit different than regular top down structure, if 🦕 can figure out the ☯, then they have more informati0n.  Being able to figure out the ☯ creates a *topDownStructure* based on 🔬 and not 🕑 in most cases.  This also helps with *needToKnow* as you can create a cypher targeted for a specific login and they use the ☯ to decode informati0n.
