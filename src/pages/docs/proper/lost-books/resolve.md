## Resolve
* [Resolve](./RESOLVE.md)

`Resolve` is a general term when critical thinking is used to solve a problem by gathering more opinions.  Because it is brainstorming solutions to a problem it uses the `pluck` syntax.

### Operator Problems
Someone is unhappy with their `identify`.
There is a `unfamiliar signal` which you can have a conversation with either `acknowledge` or `identify` them.
Two `actors` are on the same signal and they need to be separated into different `identities`.

### Information Problems
Find a missing link in a supply chain.

### Cost
Since `plucking` is used to `resolve` in most cases, it is strenuous and it is `#polite` to manage expectations about how much energy a good `resolve` takes.

### Politeness
As always, it is nice to be `#polite` especially during a `resolve` as much erroneous noise can cause confusion.  Also because of the high `attenuated signal`, being loud during this time has more of a chance to cause `echos` or make people think the trouble maker is not === lean or agile ===.

### Starting the Resolve
Sometimes as a `conversation` starter, a `documenter` can start with an `image pluck` and try to `conversation pluck` after that.

```
{ to find a suitable image }
<-- ^subject ---
^--> *images*
```
<-- [image] ---
[-->
> oh no we don't like this image
< yes please remove the image
]
```
```
