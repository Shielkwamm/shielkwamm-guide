## Layers

1 I think therefore I am, but there may not be others
2 It's good to be good
3 Don't quit your day job there is no god, only death
4 You quit your day job because making money doesn't seem to matter in the large scale of things, or at least, your expirience vessel is not as pleased to earn and keep it as others.
5 Rules are based in earthly world, I need to follow it's rules often to get to layer 7.
6 
* Layer 1ers usually keep to themselves unless they need something from you.  Or so you think. 
* Sometimes layer 2ers are the most dangerous because you trust them.
* There are a lot of layer 3ers interested in keeping the status quo.  
* Do not confuse layer 4ers with layer 1ers.
* Help layer 5ers, they may help you get to layer 7.
* Fellow layer 6ers may seem like layer 3ers sometimes, or they may be considered at layer 7 in a different stack.
* Do not expect to run into many layer 7ers, or expect to see them everywhere.
