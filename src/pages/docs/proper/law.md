K.  Whew, feel like I’ve done a good job at Integrating just a small portion of the community.  But in lean business, they tell you to focus on as specific niche as possible.  I think I have an overwhelming interest in this game, I started out solving problems, but now I feel like I’m mostly providing solutions now.  Everyone needs to be heard, but I want to leave a lot of creative expression to those who’s cultures I don’t understand well and give them time to deliberate and get the flow of this game down.

Below are some suggested laws for trash palace, we will think up a good system to review them.  I like ISLAMic law and how they review laws, their ratings are authentic, strong, weak, beautiful and many others.  But one thing, I think I would like a greater cause and effect metrics style thing democracy on this type of stuff `|| weak ||`.  If something is *ugly*, we just ignore it.  The weeds can grow other places, but they don’t have a place in my garden.  

Please email me any ideas for *monetary funnels* at iwilldevelop@AAck7ielii.th.

I’m just writing down some cool ideas I’d like to implement in a good place.  I should limit myself to how much items I have so we can streamline the focus… there is so much I want to tell people about the good place.  Maybe I should put 112 after Thomas.

Think about these things and how islamic law might rate them: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith_terminology
